# HELMET SAFETY DETECTION
> Object detection is one of the fundamentals of Computer Vision. This project will detect the whether workers properly wear helmet.
The project uses YOLOv10 model to create a bounding box around the object. The pretrained model is the nano (n) version 'yolov10n.pt' as the nano version has minimized weights which are easier to handled.

## 1. Clone the git
```sh
git clone https://github.com/khenm/object_detection_yolo_model.git
cd object_detection_yolo_model # or the folder name where you clone the git
```

## 2. Run the program in Google Colab
**Caution**: To run the program successfully, please change runtime type to GPU.  
Please follow the instructions in the notebook to succesfully run the program.
